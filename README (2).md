# IPl-Data-Analysis---PowerBI
Requirements:
The IPL Data Analysis project aimed to extract meaningful insights and create an interactive dashboard for IPL seasons spanning from 2008 to 2022. The project addressed several key requirements, which included:
1. Historical Data Analysis:
Determining the IPL Title Winner, Orange Cap Winner, Purple Cap Winner, and the team with the most tournament sixes for each IPL season. For example, in IPL 2021, the Orange Cap was won by Shikhar Dhawan, the Purple Cap by Harshal Patel, and the team with the most sixes was Royal Challengers Bangalore with 160 sixes.
2. Interactive Batting and Bowling Stats:
Developing comprehensive batting and bowling statistics. For instance, in IPL 2020, the top run-scorer was KL Rahul with 670 runs, and the highest wicket-taker was Kagiso Rabada with 30 wickets.
Implementing user-friendly filters that allow users to select specific bowlers and batsmen to view their performance statistics, such as Virat Kohli's batting stats or Jasprit Bumrah's bowling figures.
3. Winning Percentage and Toss Decision Analysis:
Analyzing the winning percentage of teams based on their decision to bat or bowl first after winning the toss. For example, teams that chose to bat first won 56% of the matches in IPL 2020.
4. Team Performance Analysis:
Evaluating the total number of wins by each IPL team in a season. In IPL 2019, Mumbai Indians had 11 wins, making them the most successful team of the season.
Categorizing matches won based on different result types, such as "by runs," "by wickets," and "Super Over."

The ability for fans to easily track their favorite players' performance and compare them against others in the same season.
Valuable data for team strategists and owners, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding toss choices.
